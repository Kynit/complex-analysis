\section{Frame 37 -- Derivatives with Real Variables}
\subsection{Definition}
In the previous chapter, we looked at derivatives of complex functions of a complex variable $z$. Now, we look at the derivatives of a complex-valued function of a real variable $t$. If we write our function as
\[
	w(t) = u(t) + iv(t)
\]
where $u$ and $v$ are real-valued, then we can define the derivative of $w$ at a point $t$ as
\[
	w'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} w(t) = u'(t) + iv'(t)
\]
provided that $u'$ and $v'$ exist at $t$.

\subsection{Properties}
If $z_0 = x_0 + iy_0$ is a complex constant, then we can show that
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d}{dt} [z_0 w(t)]
	&= [(x_0 + iy_0)(u(t) + iv(t)]' \\
	&= [x_0 u(t) - y_0 v(t)]' + i[y_0 u(t) + x_0 v(t)]' \\
	&= [x_0 u'(t) - y_0 v'(t)] + i[y_0 u'(t) + x_0 v'(t)] \\
	&= z_0 w'(t)
\end{align*}
as we expect.

Next, if $z_0$ is still a complex constant, the derivative of $e^{z_0 t}$ is
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d}{dt} e^{z_0 t} 
	&= \frac{d}{dt} e^{x_0 t}(\cos y_0 t + i sin y_0 t) \\
	&= \frac{d}{dt} e^{x_0 t} \cos y_0 t + i \frac{d}{dt} e^{x_0 t} \sin y_0 t \\
	&= (x_0 + iy_0)(e^{x_0 t} \cos y_0 t + ie^{x_0 t} \sin y_0 t) \\
	&= z_0 e^{z_0 t}
\end{align*}

Many other rules carry over from standard calculus. However, some rules no longer apply. For instance, in calculus, the mean value theorem for derivatives states that
\[
	w'(c) = \frac{w(b) - w(a)}{b - a}
\]
for some $c$ in the interval $a \le c \le b$ as long as $w$ is continuous. However, this is easily disproved by the function
\[
	w(t) = e^{it}
\]
If $a = 0$ and $b = 2\pi$, then $w(a) = w(b) = 1$ and we expect to find a point $c$ in $[0, 2\pi]$ such that $w'(c) = 0$. However, no such points exist -- the magnitude of the derivative is always $1$.

\section{Frame 38 -- Definite Integrals of Complex Functions}
\subsection{Definitions}
If $w(t)$ is a complex-valued function of a real variable $t$, as in the previous section
\[
	w(t) = u(t) + iv(t)
\]
then we define the \emph{definite integral} of $w(t)$ over the interval $a \le t \le b$ as
\[
	\int_a^b w(t) dt = \int_a^b u(t) dt + i \int_a^b v(t) dt
\]
provided the two right-side integrals exist. Then,
\begin{align*}
	\Re\left[\int_a^b w(t)dt\right] &= \int_a^b \Re[w(t)] dt \\
	\Im\left[\int_a^b w(t)dt\right] &= \int_a^b \Im[w(t)] dt
\end{align*}
Improper integrals over unbounded intervals are defined similarly.

The two real integrals will exist as long as $u$ and $v$ are \emph{piecewise continuous} on the interval $[a, b]$ -- that is, continuous everywhere in the interval except possibly for a finite number of points where it has one-sided limits. When $u$ and $v$ are piecewise continuous, we say that $w$ is also piecewise continuous.

\subsection{Properties}
The most common rules of integrals from calculus apply here as well:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\int z_0 w(t)dt = z_0 \int w(t)$
	
	\item $\int w_1(t) + w_2(t)dt = \int w_1(t)dt + \int w_2(t)dt$
	
	\item $\int_a^b w(t) dt = -\int_b^a w(t) dt$
	
	\item $\int_a^b w(t) dt = \int_a^c w(t) dt + \int_c^b w(t) dt$
\end{itemize}

We can also extend the fundamental theorem of calculus to complex integrals. Suppose that two functions
\begin{align*}
	w(t) &= u(t) + iv(t) \\
	W(t) &= U(t) + iV(t) 
\end{align*}
are continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and $W'(t) = w(t)$ when $a \le t \le b$. Then, we can write
\[
	\int_a^b w(t) dt = W(b) - W(a) = W(t) \Big|_a^b 
\] 

\textit{Example: noting that the derivative of $\frac{1}{i} e^{it}$ is
\[
	\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{i} e^{it} \right)
	= \frac{1}{i} ie^{it}
	= e^{it}
\]
we can evaluate $\int e^{it} dt$ as
\begin{align*}
	\int_0^{\pi/4} e^{it} dt 
	&= \frac{e^{it}}{i} \Big|_0^{\pi/4} \\
	&= \frac{1}{i} \left[ e^{\pi/4} - 1 \right] \\
	&= \frac{1}{i} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 1 + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \right] \\
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\left( 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)
\end{align*}}

As in the previous section, the mean value theorem for integrals does not apply. We can show this by finding the integral $\int_0^{2\pi} e^{it} dt = 0$, even though the function is never zero on this interval.

\section{Frame 39 -- Contours}
\subsection{Definitions}
In calculus, integrals are defined on intervals of the real line. In complex analysis, we instead use curves in the complex plane.

An \emph{arc} is a set of points $z = (x, y)$ in the complex plane such that the functions
\[
	x = x(t),	\quad y = y(t);	\quad z = z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)
\]
are continuous functions of the parameter $t$, where $a \le t \le b$. This definition is a continuous mapping of the interval $a \le t \le b$ into the $z$ plane.

We say that an arc is \emph{simple} if it does not cross itself; ie:
\[
	z(t_1) \ne z(t_2)	\quad \text{for all } t_1 \neq t_2
\]
If a simple arc starts and ends at the same point ($z(a) = z(b)$), it is called a \emph{simple closed curve}. These curves are \emph{positively oriented} when they are oriented in the counterclockwise direction. 

\textit{Example: the unit circle
\[
	z = e^{i\theta}
\]
where $0 \le \theta \le 2\pi$ is a positively oriented simple closed curve centered at the origin with a radius of $1$. A more general circle is
\[
	z = z_0 + Re^{i\theta}
\]
which is centered at $z_0$ and has a radius of $R$.}

\subsection{Uniqueness}
Note that the parametric representation for any arc is not unique. If we know a function $\phi$ such that
\[
	t = \phi(\tau)
\]
maps the interval $\alpha \le \tau \le \beta$ onto the interval $a \le t \le b$. Then, the two equations
\[
	z(t) \quad (a \le t \le b)
\]
and
\[
	z(\phi(t)) \quad	(\alpha \le t \le \beta)
\]
represent the same arc.

\subsection{Smoothness}
Suppose that the real and imaginary components of $z$ are differentiable, and their derivatives are continuous. Then, the arc $z(t)$ is a \emph{differentiable arc}, and
\[
	|z'(t)| = |x'(t) + iy'(t)| = \sqrt{[x'(t)]^2 + [y'(t)]^2}
\]
is integrable. This allows us to find the length of an arc as
\[
	L = \int_a^b |z'(t)| dt
\]

If an arc is differentiable and $z'(t)$ is never zero (except maybe at $t = a$ or $t = b$), then we call the arc a \emph{smooth arc}. We can write the unit tangent vector
\[
	\mathbf{T} = \frac{z'(t)}{|z'(t)|}
\]
which has an angle of inclination of $\arg z'(t)$. 

A \emph{contour} is an arc which consists of a finite number of smooth arcs joined together. Specifically, if $z(t)$ represents a contour, then $z(t)$ is continuous and $z'(t)$ is piecewise continuous. If a contour is also a simple closed arc, we call it a \emph{simple closed contour}. 

The points on a simple closed arc are the boundary points of two different domains:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The interior of the arc, which is bounded;
	\item The exterior of the arc, which is unbounded.
\end{itemize}

\section{Frame 40 -- Contour Integrals}
\subsection{Definitions and conditions}
We can now integrate a complex function $f$ along a contour $C$, which starts and ends at points $z_1$ and $z_2$, respectively. This is effectively a line integral. These integrals can be written as
\[
	\int_C f(z) dz
\]
or, if the integral does not depend on the path taken,
\[
	\int_{z_1}^{z_2} f(z) dz
\]

This integral (along a complex path) represents an integral with respect to a real parameter $t$. If the contour $C$ is written as $z(t)$ on the interval $a \le t \le b$, then the integral represented is
\[
	\int_C f(z) dz = \int_a^b f[z(t)] z'(t) dt
\]
Since $z'(t)$ must be piecewise continuous, this integral exists as long as $f[z(t)]$ is also piecewise continuous on this interval.

\subsection{Basic properties}
From the definition and the properties of integrals, we can write
\[
	\int_C z_0 f(z) dz = z_0 \int_C f(z) dz
\]
and
\[
	\int_C [f(z) + g(z)] dz = \int_C f(z) dz + \int_C g(z) dz
\]
We can also create a new contour $-C$ that consists of the points in $C$ in reversed order -- this contour extends from $z_2$ to $z_1$. Integrating along this reversed contour, we find that
\begin{align*}
	\int_-C f(z) dz 
	&= \int_{-b}^{-a} f[z(-t)] \frac{d}{dt} z(-t) dt \\
	&= -\int_{-b}^{-a} f[z(-t)] z'(-t) dt \\
	&= -\int_a^b f[z(t)] z'(t) dt \\
	&= -\int_C f(z) dz
\end{align*}
We can also split up a contour $C$ into multiple legs $C_1, C_2, \dots$. If we can write a contour this way, then we say that $C = C_1 + C_2$. The contour integral along $C$ can then be written as
\[
	\int_C f(z) dz = \int_{C_1} f(z) dz + \int_{C_2} f(z) dz
\]


\clearpage
\section{Frame 41 -- Examples of Contour Integrals}
This section will show several specific examples of contour integrals.

\subsection{Example 1}
Suppose that the contour $C$ is the right hand half of the circle $|z| = 2$:
\[
	z = 2e^{i\theta},	\quad \left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\]
Then,
\begin{align*}
	\int_C \bar{z} dz
	&= \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \bar{2e^{i\theta}} (2e^{i\theta})' d\theta \\
	&= 4i\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} e^{-i\theta} e^{i\theta} d\theta \\
	&= 4i\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} d\theta \\
	&= 4\pi i
\end{align*}
Also, note that all of the points on this semicircle satisfy
\[
	z \bar{z} = |z|^2 = 4
\]
so we can see from this result that
\[
	\int_C \frac{1}{z} dz = \pi i
\]

\subsection{Example 2}
Suppose that the points $O$, $A$, and $B$ are $0$, $i$, and $1 + i$, respectively. Then, if $C_1$ is the polyline $OAB$ and
\[
	f(z) = y - x - i3x^2
\]
then the contour integral of $f$ along $C_1$ is
\begin{align*}
	\int_{C_1} f(z) dz
	&= \int_{OA} f(z) dz + \int_{AB} f(z) dz \\
	&= \int_0^1 yi dy + \int_0^1 (1 - x - i3x^2) dx \\
	&= \frac{i}{2} + \int_0^1 (1 - x)dx - 3i\int_0^1 x^2 dx \\
	&= \frac{i}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - i \\
	&= \frac{1 - i}{2}
\end{align*}

Next, if $C_2$ is the line $OB$, the contour integral along this curve is
\begin{align*}
	\int_{C_2} f(z) dz 
	&= \int_0^1 -i3x^2(1 + i)dx \\
	&= 3(1 - i) \int_0^1 x^2 \\
	&= 1 - i
\end{align*}

Finally, the integral of $f$ over the simple closed contour $OABO$ is $C_1 - C_2$, which is
\[
	\int_{OABO} f(z) dz = \frac{-1 + i}{2}
\]

\subsection{Example 3}
Suppose that $C$ is any arbitrary smooth arc from a fixed point $z_1$ to another point $z_2$:
\[
	z = z(t)	\quad (a \le t \le b)
\]
The contour integral of $f(z) = z$ along this curve is
\begin{align*}
	\int_C z dz 
	&= \int_a^b z(t) z'(t) dt \\
	&= \int_a^b \frac{d}{dt} \frac{[z(t)]^2}{2} dt \\
	&= \frac{[z(t)]^2}{2} \Big|_a^b \\
	&= \frac{z_2^2 - z_1^2}{2}
\end{align*}
Note that this integral only depends on the endpoints of $C$ and not the path. This lets us write
\[
	\int_{z_1}^{z_2} z dz = \frac{z_2^2 - z_1^2}{2}
\]
This holds when $C$ is not a smooth contour. Since all contours are sums of finite numbers of smooth arcs, this expression holds for each arc in $C$, leading to the same final expression.

Also, note that the integral of $f(z) = z$ around any closed contour in the plane is zero.


\clearpage
\section{Frame 42 -- Examples with Branch Cuts}
A contour integral's path can include a point on a branch cut. The following two examples show this.

\subsection{Example 1}
Suppose we want to integrate the function 
\[
	f(z) = z^{1/2} = e^{\frac{1}{2} \log z}	\quad (0 < \arg z < 2\pi)
\]
on the semicircle
\[
	z = 3e^{i\theta}	\quad(0 \le \theta \le \pi)
\]
Although the function is not defined at $\theta = 0$, we can still write
\[
	f[z(\theta)] = e^{\frac{1}{2}(\ln 3 + i\theta)} = \sqrt{3} e^{i\theta/2}
\]
and the right hand limit of this function exists at $\theta = 0$. Thus, the integrand exists as long as we define the missing point as
\[
	f[z(0)] z'(0) = i3\sqrt{3}
\]
Then,
\begin{align*}
	\int_C f(z) dz 
	&= 3\sqrt{3} \int_0^\pi e^{i3\theta / 2} \\
	&= 3\sqrt{3} \frac{2}{3i} e^{i3\theta / 2} \Big|_0^\pi \\
	&= -\frac{2}{3i} (1 + i) \\
	&= -2\sqrt{3}(1 + i)
\end{align*}


\subsection{Example 2}
Suppose that we want to integrate the function
\[
	f(z) = z^{a - 1} = e^{(a - 1) \Log z} \quad (-\pi < \Arg z < \pi)
\]
on the positively oriented circle
\[
	z = Re^{i\theta}	\quad (-\pi \le \theta \le \pi)
\]
The contour integral is
\begin{align*}
	\int_C z^{a - 1} dz
	&= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} iR^ae^{ia\theta} d\theta \\
	&= iR^a \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{ia\theta} d\theta \\
	&= iR^a \left( \frac{e^{ia\theta}}{ia} \right)_{-\pi}^{\pi} \\
	&= i\frac{2R^a}{a} \frac{e^{ia\pi} - e^{-ia\pi}}{2i} \\
	&= i\frac{2R^a}{a} \sin a\pi
\end{align*}
Note that if $a$ is a non-zero integer, this integral is zero; if $a = 0$, this integral reduces to
\[
	\int_C \frac{dz}{z} = 2\pi i
\]


\clearpage
\section{Frame 43 -- Upper Bounds for Contour Integrals}
We can put a bound on the modulus of a contour integral by observing that
\[
	\left| \int_a^b w(t) dt \right| 
	\le \int_a^b \left| w(t) \right| dt
\]

\subsection{Theorem}
Suppose that $C$ is a contour with a length of $L$ and that $f(z)$ is a function that is piecewise continuous on $C$. If $M \ge 0$ is a real constant such that
\[
	|f(z)| \le M
\]
for all points on $C$, then
\[
	\left| \int_C f(z) dz \right| \le ML
\]
Note that such a number $M$ will always exist because $f$ is continuous on $C$.

\subsection{Examples}
\textit{Example: Suppose that
\[
	f(z) = \frac{z + 4}{z^3 - 1}
\]
and the contour $C$ is a quarter circle with a radius of $2$ in the first quadrant (running from $z = 2$ to $z = 2i$). Since $|z| = 2$ at all points on this contour, we can write that
\[
	|z + 4| \le |z| + 4 = 6
\]
and
\[
	|z^3 - 1| \ge |z|^3 - 1 = 7
\]
Since the length of the contour is $L = \pi$, we can write the upper bound
\[
	\left| \int_C \frac{z + 4}{z^3 - 1} dz \right| \le \frac{6\pi}{7}
\]
}

\textit{Example: suppose that $C_R$ is the semicircular contour
\[
	z = Re^{i\theta}	\quad	(0 \le \theta \le \pi)
\]
and $f$ is the function
\[
	f(z) = \frac{z^{1/2}}{z^2 + 1}
\]
where $z^{1/2}$ denotes the branch $-\pi/2 < \theta < 3\pi/2$. Anywhere on this semicircle,
\[
	|z^{1/2}| = \sqrt{R}
\]
and
\[
	|z^2 + 1| \ge ||z^2| - 1| = R^2 - 1
\]
Since the contour has a length of $\pi R$, the contour integral of $f$ along $C$ can be limited by
\begin{align*}
	\int_C f(z) dz 
	&\le \frac{\sqrt{R}}{R^2 - 1} \cdot \pi R \\
	&= \frac{\pi R^{3/2}}{R^2 - 1} \\
	&= \frac{\pi / \sqrt{R}}{1 - (1 / R^2)}
\end{align*}
As $R$ approaches infinity, this bound approaches zero, so
\[
	\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_C f(z) dz = 0
\]}
