\section{Frame 29 -- The Exponential Function}
\subsection{Definition}
We define the \emph{exponential function} $e^z$ by writing
\[
	e^z = e^x e^{iy}
\]
and we apply Euler's formula to get
\[
	e^z = e^x (\cos y + i \sin y)
\]
Note that, when $y = 0$, $e^z$ reduces to $e^x$. 

Although we typically understand that $e^{1/n}$ would be the set of $n$th roots of $e$, here, we only use the real, positive root $\sqrt[n]{e}$.

\subsection{Familar properties}
First, in calculus, we know that
\[
	e^{x_1} e^{x_2} = e^{x_1 + x_2}
\]
It is easy to verify that this holds true for complex numbers:
\[
	e^{z_1} e^{z_2} = e^{z_1 + z_2}
\]
This also allows us to write
\[
	\frac{e^{z_1}}{e^{z_2}} = e^{z_1 - z_2}
\]
and, as a specific case,
\[
	\frac{1}{e^{z}} = e^{-z}
\]

We showed earlier that $e^z$ is differentiable everywhere in the complex plane, and that
\[
	\frac{d}{dz} e^z = e^z
\]
We also know that $e^z$ is never zero. This comes from the pair
\[
	|e^z| = e^x	\quad \text{and} \quad	\text{arg}(e^z) = y + 2n\pi
\]
and since $e^x$ is never zero, neither is $e^z$.

\subsection{Unfamiliar properties}
Since we can write
\[
	e^{z + 2\pi i} = e^z e^{2\pi i} = e^z
\]
the exponential function is periodic with an imaginary period of $2\pi i$.

It is also possible for the complex exponential function to be negative. For an example, we know that Euler's identity states
\[
	e^{i\pi} = -1
\]
In fact, $e^z$ can be any given non-zero complex number.

\textit{Example: suppose we want solutions to the equation
\[
	e^z = 1 + i
\]
The right side can be rewritten as
\[
	e^x e^{iy} = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi / 4}
\]
and equating the parts of this equation gives
\[
	x = \ln \sqrt{2} = \frac{1}{2} \ln 2 \quad	\text{and} \quad 
	y = \left(2n + \frac{1}{4}\right) \pi
\]
so
\[
	z = \frac{1}{2} \ln 2 + \left( 2n + \frac{1}{4} \right) \pi i
\]}
